\section{Introduction}


\textsf{SageMath} (\url{http://sagemath.org/}) is a modern free,
open-source mathematics software system, which is
based on the Python programming language. It makes use of over 90 open-source packages,
among which are \textsf{Maxima} and \textsf{Pynac} (symbolic calculations),
\textsf{GAP} (group theory),
\textsf{PARI/GP} (number theory), \textsf{Singular} (polynomial computations),
and \textsf{matplotlib} (high quality 2D figures).
\textsf{SageMath} provides a uniform Python interface to all these packages; however,
\textsf{SageMath} is much more than a mere interface: it contains a large and increasing part of
original code (more than 750,000 lines of Python and Cython, involving 5344 classes).
\textsf{SageMath} was created in 2005 by W. Stein \cite{SteinJ05} and since
then its development has been sustained by more than a hundred researchers
(mostly mathematicians). Very good introductory textbooks about \textsf{SageMath} are
\cite{JoyneS14,Zimme13,Bard15}.

The \textsf{SageManifolds} extension to
\textsf{SageMath} provides capability for differential geometry and tensor calculus
(\url{http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/}), which we are using here to perform
some computations related to these lectures.

There are basically two ways to use \textsf{SageMath} + \textsf{SageManifolds}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Install it on your computer, by downloading the sources or a binary version
from \url{http://sagemath.org/}; \textsf{SageManifolds} is progressively integrated
into \textsf{SageMath}, but this step-by-step process is not finished yet. So
one has to install \textsf{SageManifolds} in addition to \textsf{SageMath}, by
following the instructions\footnote{On a Linux system, this reduces to simply type
two commands in a terminal:\\
\texttt{wget -N http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/spkg/sm-install.sh}\\
\texttt{bash sm-install.sh}}
at \\ \url{http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/download.html}.
\item Use it online at the \textsf{SageMathCloud} (\url{https://cloud.sagemath.com/});
since \textsf{SageManifolds} is installed on \textsf{SageMathCloud}, you can
use it directly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Schwarzschild horizon}

This worksheet accompanies Chap.~\ref{s:def} in treating the future event horizon of
Schwarzschild spacetime in 3+1 Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates as an example of null hypersurface:\\[1ex]

\subsection{Conformal completion of Minkowski spacetime}

This worksheet accompanies Chap.~\ref{s:glo}; in particular, it provides
many figures for Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_Mink}.\\[1ex]

\subsection{Kerr metric as a solution of Einstein equation} \label{s:sam:Kerr_solution}

This worksheet accompanies Chap.~\ref{s:ker}: the Kerr metric, expressed in Boyer-Lindquist
coordinates, is shown to be a solution of the vacuum Einstein equation. Moreover, the Kretschmann scalar is computed.\\[1ex]

}

\subsection{Kerr spacetime in 3+1 Kerr coordinates} \label{s:sam:Kerr_Kerr_coord}

This worksheet accompanies Chap.~\ref{s:ker}: the Kerr metric is expressed in 3+1 Kerr coordinates, the vacuum Einstein equation is checked, the outgoing and ingoing principal null geodesics are considered and the black hole surface gravity is computed.\\[1ex]
{\footnotesize

}

\subsection{Trapping horizon in Vaidya spacetime} \label{s:sam:Vaidya_trapping}

This worksheet accompanies Chap.~\ref{s:loc}: the Vaidya metric is expressed in 3+1 Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, the Einstein equation is checked, the outgoing and ingoing radial null geodesics are computed and the trapping horizon and the event
horizon are drawn in a spacetime diagram. \\[1ex]
