\section{Introduction}

Geodesics play a key role in general relativity, since they represent
the worldlines of test particles, either massive ones or masseless ones (photons)
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:worldlines}). Moreover, in the context of black holes,
null geodesics play a proeminant role, as the generator of the event horizons
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H}). We review here the definition and
properties of geodesics on a generic pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
Contrary to Appendix~\ref{s:bas}, proofs of the various properties will be provided.


\section{Definition and first properties}

\subsection{Geodesics and affine parametrizations} \label{s:geo:def}

On a Riemannian manifold, i.e. a manifold equipped with a positive definite metric
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:signature}), a geodesic is the curve of minimal length between
two points (at least for close enough points). It is also a curve which is
``as straight as possible'', in the sense that its tangent vectors are transported parallel
to themselves along it. A typical example is a geodesic in the Euclidean space: this is
necessarily a straight line; it is then obvious that its tangent vectors
keep a fixed direction. In a \emph{pseudo}-Riemannian manifold, such as the
spacetimes of general relativity, one uses
the second property to define geodesics:
\begin{greybox}
A smooth curve $\mathcal{C}$ of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(\M,\w{g})$ is
called a \defin{geodesic} iff it admits a parametrization $P$ whose associated
tangent vector field $\w{v}$ is transported parallellely to itself along
$\mathcal{C}$:
\be \label{e:geo:geod_eq_v}
    \encadre{\wnab_{\w{v}}\,\w{v} = 0},
\ee
where $\wnab$ is the Levi-Civita connection associated with $\w{g}$.
The parametrization $P$ is then called an
\defin{affine parametrization}\index{affine!parametrization}\index{parametrization!affine --}
and the corresponding parameter $\lambda$ is called an
\defin{affine paramater}\index{affine!parameter}\index{parameter!affine --} of the
geodesic $\mathcal{C}$. Note that the relation between $\w{v}$ and $\lambda$ is
\be \label{e:geo:v_dxdlambda}
    \w{v} = \frac{\D\w{x}}{\D\lambda} ,
\ee
where $\D\w{x}$ is the infinitesimal displacement along $\mathcal{C}$ corresponding
to the change $\D\lambda$ in the parameter $\lambda$
(cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:dell_v_dlamb})).
\end{greybox}
In the above definition, let us recall that a \emph{curve} $\mathcal{C}$ is the image of a map (called
a \emph{parametrization}) $P:\ I\rightarrow \M$,
where $I$ is an interval of $\R$, spanned by $\lambda$ (cf Sec.~\ref{s:bas:vectors}).
Moreover, we exclude the case where $\mathcal{C}$ is reduced to a single point
of $\M$, i.e. where $P$ is a constant function.

The qualifier \emph{affine} in the above definition stems from the following
property:
\begin{greybox}
Any two affine parametrizations of a geodesic $\mathcal{C}$ are necessarily
related by an affine transformation:
\be \label{e:geo:affine_transf}
    \lambda' = a \lambda + b,
\ee
where $a$ and $b$ are two real constants such that $a\not = 0$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Let $P: I \to  \mathcal{C}$, $\lambda\mapsto P(\lambda)$ and
$P': I'\to \mathcal{C}$,
$\lambda'\mapsto P'(\lambda')$ be two
parametrizations of $\mathcal{C}$. They are necessarily related by a
diffeomorphism $I\to I'$, $\lambda \mapsto \lambda'(\lambda)$. It follows
from (\ref{e:geo:v_dxdlambda}) that the tangent vector fields $\w{v}$ and $\w{v'}$
associated with these two parametrizations are related by
\[
    \w{v} = \frac{\D\lambda'}{\D\lambda} \, \w{v'} .
\]
Using the rules 2 and 3 governing the connection $\wnab$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:affine_connect}),
we get then
\be \label{e:geo:acc_v_acc_vp}
    \wnab_{\w{v}}\,\w{v} = \frac{\D^2\lambda'}{\D\lambda^2} \, \w{v'}
    + \left( \frac{\D\lambda'}{\D\lambda} \right)^2 \wnab_{\w{v'}}\,\w{v'} .
\ee
If both parametrizations are affine, then $\wnab_{\w{v}}\,\w{v} = 0$ and
$\wnab_{\w{v'}}\,\w{v'} = 0$, so that the above identity reduces to
${\D^2\lambda'}/{\D\lambda^2} = 0$, which implies
the affine law (\ref{e:geo:affine_transf}).
\end{proof}

An important property of geodesics is
\begin{greybox}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a geodesic of $(\M,\w{g})$ and $\w{v}$ a tangent vector field
associated with an affine parametrization of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the
scalar square of $\w{v}$ with respect to the metric $\w{g}$
is constant along $\mathcal{C}$:
\be \label{e:geo:vv_const}
    \w{g}(\w{v},\w{v}) = \mathrm{const}.
\ee
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
The variation of $\w{g}(\w{v},\w{v})$ along $\mathcal{C}$ is given
by
\bea
 \wnab_{\w{v}} \left[ \w{g}(\w{v},\w{v}) \right] & = & v^\mu \nabla_\mu (g_{\rho\sigma} v^\rho v^\sigma) \nonumber \\
            & = & v^\mu \underbrace{\nabla_\mu g_{\rho\sigma}}_{0} v^\rho v^\sigma
                + g_{\rho\sigma} \underbrace{v^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\rho}_{0} v^\sigma
                + g_{\rho\sigma} v^\rho \underbrace{v^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\sigma}_{0}  \nonumber \\
            & = & 0 ,  \nonumber
\eea
where we have used the facts that $\wnab$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $\w{g}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:nabla_g_zero})] and $\w{v}$ obeys the geodesic equation (\ref{e:geo:geod_eq_v}).
\end{proof}
For a Lorentzian manifold, the constancy of $\w{g}(\w{v},\w{v})$ has an
intersesting corollary: the tangent vector $\w{v}$ cannot change its type
along $\mathcal{C}$. Hence:
\begin{greybox}
In a Lorentzian manifold $(\M,\w{g})$, a geodesic $\mathcal{C}$ belongs necessarily
to one of the following three categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item \defin{timelike geodesic}\index{timelike!geodesic}\index{geodesic!timelike --}:
tangent vectors are timelike at any point of $\mathcal{C}$;
\item \defin{null geodesic}\index{null!geodesic}\index{geodesic!null --}:
tangent vectors are null at any point of $\mathcal{C}$;
\item \defin{spacelike geodesic}\index{spacelike!geodesic}\index{geodesic!spacelike --}:
tangent vectors are spacelike at any point of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{greybox}
This is in sharp contrast with generic curves, which can be, for instance, timelike on some portions
and null or spacelike on other portions. In the timelike case, or the spacelike one,
the tangent vector field $\w{v}$ can be rescaled by the constant $\sqrt{|\w{g}(\w{v},\w{v})|}$ to get
a unit tangent vector field, i.e. a tangent vector field $\w{u}$ which obeys
$\w{g}(\w{u},\w{u}) = -1$ (timelike geodesic) or $\w{g}(\w{u},\w{u}) = 1$
(spacelike geodesic). Moreover, in doing so, we preserve the affine character of the
parametrization. Indeed, the rescaling amounts to choosing the constant $a$
in the affine law~(\ref{e:geo:affine_transf}) such that $a = \sqrt{|\w{g}(\w{v},\w{v})|}$.
Thus, we have
\begin{greybox}
A timelike or spacelike geodesic of a Lorentzian manifold has a unique affine parametrization,
up to an additive constant $b$ and a choice of orientation ($a=\pm 1$ in (\ref{e:geo:affine_transf})),
the tangent vector of which is a unit vector (i.e. of scalar square $\pm 1$ with respect to
$\w{g}$).
\end{greybox}
We shall see in Sec.~\ref{s:geo:gener_param} that for a timelike geodesic,
the affine parameter with unit tangent vector is nothing but the
\emph{proper time}\index{proper!time}\index{time!proper --} (up to some choice of
time orientation), while for a spacelike
geodesic, it is the \emph{arc length}\index{arc length}.

\subsection{Generic parametrizations of geodesics} \label{s:geo:gener_param}

Geodesics can be characterized by any of their tangent vectors, i.e.
tangent vectors not necessarily associated with an affine parametrization, as follows:
\begin{greybox}
A curve $\mathcal{C}$ is a geodesic
iff the tangent vector field $\w{v}$ associated with any parametrization
of $\mathcal{C}$ obeys
\be \label{e:geo:v_pregeodesic}
    \wnab_{\w{v}}\,\w{v} = \kappa\,  \w{v},
\ee
where $\kappa$ is a scalar field along $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Let $P: I\to \mathcal{C}$, $\lambda\mapsto P(\lambda)$ be the parametrization of $\mathcal{C}$
corresponding to the tangent vector field $\w{v}$: $\w{v} = \D\w{x}/\D\lambda$.
If $\mathcal{C}$ is a geodesic, then there exists a parametrization
$\lambda'\mapsto P'(\lambda')$ whose tangent vector, $\w{v'}$ say, obeys
$\wnab_{\w{v'}}\,\w{v'} = 0$. Since any two parametrizations of $\mathcal{C}$
are related by Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:acc_v_acc_vp}), we deduce that $\w{v}$ obeys
(\ref{e:geo:v_pregeodesic}) with
\[
    \kappa = \left( \frac{\D\lambda'}{\D\lambda} \right)^{-1}
        \frac{\D^2\lambda'}{\D\lambda^2} .
\]
Conversely, if $\w{v}$ obeys (\ref{e:geo:v_pregeodesic}) with $\kappa=\kappa(\lambda)$,
then Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:acc_v_acc_vp}) implies that $\wnab_{\w{v'}}\,\w{v'} = 0$,
i.e. that $\mathcal{C}$ is a geodesic, provided that the change of
parametrization $\lambda' = \lambda'(\lambda)$ fulfills
\[
    \kappa(\lambda) \frac{\D\lambda'}{\D\lambda} -  \frac{\D^2\lambda'}{\D\lambda^2} = 0 .
\]
This differential equation has the following solution:
\[
    \lambda' = a \int_{\lambda_1}^\lambda \left[ \exp \left(
    \int_{\lambda_0}^{\tilde{\lambda}} \kappa(\tilde{\tilde{\lambda}})
    \D\tilde{\tilde{\lambda}}\right) \D\tilde\lambda
    \right] + b,
\]
where $a$, $b$, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ are constants, with $a\not = 0$ and $\lambda_0,\lambda_1\in I$.
\end{proof}
The above property motivates the following definitions:
\begin{greybox}
A vector field $\w{v}$ obeying (\ref{e:geo:v_pregeodesic}) is called
a \defin{pregeodesic vector field}\index{pregeodesic vector field}.
The scalar field $\kappa$ is then called the \defin{non-affinity coefficient}\index{non-affinity coefficient} of $\w{v}$.
If $\kappa=0$, $\w{v}$ is naturally called a \defin{geodesic vector field}\index{geodesic!vector field}.
\end{greybox}
Note that the property established above is equivalent to stating that the
field lines of a pregeodesic vector field are geodesics.

An easy consequence of Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:v_pregeodesic}) is the following
evolution law for the scalar square of the tangent vector:
\begin{greybox}
Along a geodesic $\mathcal{C}$, the scalar square $\w{g}(\w{v},\w{v})$
of the tangent vector $\w{v}$ associated with any parametrization of $\mathcal{C}$
evolves according to
\be \label{e:geo:evol_vv_kappa}
    \wnab_{\w{v}} \left[ \w{g}(\w{v},\w{v}) \right] = 2 \kappa \, \w{g}(\w{v},\w{v}),
\ee
where $\kappa$ is the non-affinity coefficient of $\w{v}$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
One has, using $\wnab\w{g}=0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:nabla_g_zero})] and Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:v_pregeodesic}),
\[
    v^\mu \nabla_\mu (g_{\rho\sigma} v^\rho v^\sigma)  = v^\mu \underbrace{\nabla_\mu g_{\rho\sigma}}_{0} v^\rho v^\sigma
                + g_{\rho\sigma} \underbrace{v^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\rho}_{\kappa v^\rho} v^\sigma
                + g_{\rho\sigma} v^\rho \underbrace{v^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\sigma}_{\kappa v^\sigma}
             = 2 \kappa  g_{\rho\sigma} v^\rho v^\sigma  ,
\]
hence the law (\ref{e:geo:evol_vv_kappa}).
\end{proof}
We recover of course (\ref{e:geo:vv_const}) in the special case $\kappa = 0$
($\w{v}$ geodesic vector).
\begin{remark}
If $\lambda$ is the parameter associated with $\w{v}$: $\w{v} = \D\w{x}/\D\lambda$,
we may introduce the scalar function $V(\lambda) := \w{g}(\w{v},\w{v})$ and
rewrite (\ref{e:geo:evol_vv_kappa}) as a first-order ordinary differential equation
for it [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_vector})]:
\be
    \frac{\D V}{\D\lambda} = 2 \kappa(\lambda) V(\lambda) .
\ee
\end{remark}
A consequence of (\ref{e:geo:evol_vv_kappa}) is
\begin{greybox}
On a Lorentzian manifold, the parametrization of a timelike geodesic
by the proper time\index{time!proper --} ($\lambda = \tau$) is an affine parametrization.
Similarly, on a Lorentzian or Riemannian manifold, the parametrization of a
spacelike geodesic
by the arc length\index{arc length} ($\lambda = s$) is an affine parametrization.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
The tangent vector associated with the proper time $\tau$ along a timelike geodesic
is nothing but the 4-velocity $\w{u}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:massive_part}), which
of constant scalar square: $\w{g}(\w{u},\w{u}) = -1$, so that Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:evol_vv_kappa})
reduces to $0 = -2 \kappa$, hence $\kappa=0$, which implies that we are dealing
with an affine parametrization. Similarly, the tangent vector associated with the
arc length $s$ along a spacelike geodesic has a scalar square everywhere equal
to 1, leading to the same conclusion.
\end{proof}


\section{The geodesic equation}

\begin{greybox}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a curve in a pseudo-Riemannian
manifold $(\M,\w{g})$ of dimension $n$. Let us assume that
$\mathcal{C}$ is contained in the domain of a coordinate chart $(x^\alpha)_{0\leq\alpha\leq n-1}$,
so that any parametrization of $\mathcal{C}$, $P: I \to  \mathcal{C}$, $\lambda\mapsto P(\lambda)$,
can be described by $n$ functions $X^\alpha: I\to \R$
according to Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:curve_param_equation}): $x^\alpha(P(\lambda)) = X^\alpha(\lambda)$.
Then the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is a geodesic iff there exists a paramatrization of $\mathcal{C}$
for which the functions $X^\alpha$ fullfills the following
system of $n$ second-order differential equations, usually called the
\defin{geodesic equation}\index{geodesic!equation}\index{equation!geodesic --}:
\be \label{e:geo:eq_geod}
    \encadre{ \frac{\D^2 X^\alpha}{\D\lambda^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu}
    \frac{\D X^\mu}{\D\lambda} \frac{\D X^\nu}{\D\lambda} = 0 },  \qquad 0 \leq \alpha \leq n-1,
\ee
where the $\Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu}$'s are the Christoffel symbols\index{Christoffel symbols} of the metric $\w{g}$
with respect to the coordinates $(x^\alpha)$, as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Christoffel}).
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Notice first that the components with respect
to the chart $(x^\alpha)$ of the tangent
vector field $\w{v}$ associated with the parameter $\lambda$ are [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:va_dXadlamb})]
\be \label{e:geo:va_dXadlamb}
    v^\alpha = \frac{\D X^\alpha}{\D\lambda} .
\ee
On the other side, the components of $\wnab_{\w{v}}\,\w{v}$ are
\[
    v^\mu \nabla_\mu v^\alpha = v^\mu \der{v^\alpha}{x^\mu} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu} v^\mu v^\nu
    = \w{v}(v^\alpha) + \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu} v^\mu v^\nu
    = \frac{\D v^\alpha}{\D \lambda} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu} v^\mu v^\nu ,
\]
where we have used
successively Eqs.~(\ref{e:bas:der_cov_coord}), (\ref{e:bas:v_va_wpar_a}) and
(\ref{e:bas:def_vector}). The above relation, along with (\ref{e:geo:va_dXadlamb}),
shows that the left-hand side of
Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:eq_geod}) is nothing but the component $\alpha$ of
$\wnab_{\w{v}}\,\w{v}$. The conclusion follows from the very definition
of a geodesic given in Sec.~\ref{s:geo:def}.
\end{proof}

We have the fundamental existence and uniqueness result:
\begin{greybox}
Given a point $p$ in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(\M,\w{g})$ and a vector
$\w{v}_0$ in the tangent space to $\M$ at $p$, i.e. $\w{v}_0 \in T_p\M$,
there exists a geodesic $\mathcal{C}$ through $p$ such that
$\w{v}_0$ is the value at $p$ of the tangent vector of some parametrization
of $\mathcal{C}$:
\be
    \w{v}_0 = \left. \frac{\D\w{x}}{\D\lambda} \right|_p
\ee
and this geodesic is unique, in the sense that if a geodesic $\mathcal{C}'$
share the same property, then $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}'$ coincide
in some open neighbourhood of $p$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Let $(x^\alpha)$ be a coordinate chart of $\M$ around $p$. Let $(v_0^\alpha)$
be the component of $\w{v}_0$ in the basis of $T_p\M$ induced by
the coordinate frame $(\wpar_\alpha)$ associated with $(x^\alpha)$:
\[
    \w{v}_0 = v_0^\alpha \left. \wpar_\alpha \right| _p .
\]
A geodesic through $p$ having $\w{v}_0$ as tangent vector at $p$ is then
obtained as a solution $(X^\alpha(\lambda))$ of the system (\ref{e:geo:eq_geod})
with the initial conditions
\be \label{e:geo:init_cond}
    X^\alpha(0) = x^\alpha(p) \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \frac{\D X^\alpha}{\D\lambda}(0) = v_0^\alpha .
\ee
The system (\ref{e:geo:eq_geod}) + (\ref{e:geo:init_cond}) constitutes a well-posed
Cauchy problem\index{Cauchy problem} and standard results about ordinary
differential equations, e.g. the Picard-Lindelöf (or Cauchy–Lipschitz) theorem,
guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution.
\end{proof}

A few definitions are in order:

\begin{greybox}
A geodesic $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be \defin{maximal}\index{maximal!geodesic}\index{geodesic!maximal --}
or \defin{inextendible}\index{inextendible geodesic}\index{geodesic!inextendible --} iff
there does not exist any geodesic $\mathcal{C}'$ such that  $\mathcal{C}\subset\mathcal{C}'$ and
$\mathcal{C}'\not=\mathcal{C}$.
\end{greybox}

\begin{greybox}
A geodesic $\mathcal{C}$ is \defin{complete}\index{complete!geodesic}\index{geodesic!complete --}
iff it is maximal and the interval spanned by any of its affine parameters is the whole real line:
$I=\R$. The pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(\M,\w{g})$ is said to be \defin{geodesically complete}
iff every maximal geodesic is complete.
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark}
A well-known theorem of differential geometry, namely the \defin{Hopf-Rinow theorem}\index{Hopf-Rinow theorem},
states that a connected \emph{Riemannian} manifold is geodesically complete iff it is \emph{complete}
as a \emph{metric space}\index{metric!space} for the distance function $d(p,q)$ defined as the infimum of the
the metric length of all curves connecting the two points $p$ and $q$
(see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Lee97}). However, there is no such theorem for \emph{Lorentzian}
manifolds, for the metric does not induce any distance function induced turning them into a metric space.
\end{remark}


We have the following proposition, strengthening the existence and uniqueness
result obtained above:
\begin{greybox}
Given a point $p$ in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(\M,\w{g})$ and a vector
$\w{v}_0$ in the tangent space to $\M$ at $p$, i.e. $\w{v}_0 \in T_p\M$,
there exists a unique maximal geodesic $\mathcal{C}$ through $p$ such that
$\w{v}_0$ is the value at $p$ of the tangent vector of some parametrization
of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{greybox}
We refer to O'Neill's textbook \cite{ONeil83}, p.~68 for the proof.
