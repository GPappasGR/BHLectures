\section{Introduction}

We have already investigated some geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime in
Chap.~\ref{s:sch}, namely
the radial null geodesics (Sec.~\ref{s:sch:rad_null_geod}).
Here, we perform a more extended study. In particular we investigate timelike
geodesics, which are of primordial physical importance, since they represent
the wordlines of planets or stars orbiting the black hole or of
intrepid observers freely falling into the black hole.

\section{First integrals of motion}

Let $\Li$ be a geodesic\footnote{The definition and basic properties of geodesics
are recalled in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}.} of Schwarzschild spacetime
$(\M,\w{g})$. We shall assume that $\Li$ is either timelike or null\footnote{As
shown in Sec.~\ref{s:geo:def}, a geodesic cannot be timelike of some parts
and null on other ones.}. It therefore can be considered as the worldline
of some particle $\mathscr{P}$, either massive
(timelike case) or masseless (null case).
Let us denote by $\w{p}$ the 4-momentum of $\mathscr{P}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:worldlines})

The Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ associated with the staticity
of $(\M,\w{g})$, introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:sch:static_spher}, gives birth
to a conserved quantity along $\Li$, namely the scalar product of $\w{\xi}$
by $\w{p}$.
