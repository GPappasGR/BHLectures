\section{Introduction}

We have already investigated some geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime in
Chap.~\ref{s:sch}, namely
the radial null geodesics (Sec.~\ref{s:sch:rad_null_geod}).
Here, we perform a more extended study. In particular we investigate timelike
geodesics, which are of primordial physical importance, since they represent
the wordlines of planets or stars orbiting the black hole or of
intrepid observers freely falling into the black hole.
