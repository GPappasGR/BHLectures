\section{Introduction}

Having attempted in Chap.~\ref{s:def} to characterize a black hole by the local
properties of its boundary, we turn now to the general definition of a black
hole. As it could have been anticipated from the naive ``definition'' given
in Sec.~\ref{s:def:first_defin}, the mathematically meaningful definition
of a black hole cannot be local: it has to take into account the full
spacetime structure, in particular its future asymptotics. Indeed, to decide
whether a null geodesic has escaped or not, one has to wait until the ``end
of time''...

In this chapter, we therefore consider the global spacetime picture to
arrive at the general definition of a black hole in
Sec.~\ref{s:glo:def_BH}.
This amounts to focusing on the
spacetime asymptotics, which can be seen as
the region where the ``distant observers'' live and may, or may not, receive
light rays from some ``central region''. This far-away structure is best
described in terms of the so-called \emph{conformal completion}, which brings
the spacetime infinity(ies) to a finite distance in another manifold.
We start by investigating the conformal completion of the simplest
spacetime: Minkowski spacetime.

\section{Conformal completion of Minkowski spacetime}

In this section $(\M,\w{g})$ is the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime,
i.e. $\M$ is a smooth manifold diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\w{g}$
is the metric tensor whose expression in terms of some global coordinates
$(x^\alpha) = (t, x, y, z)$ implementing the diffeomorphism to $\mathbb{R}^4$
(i.e. \defin{Minkowskian coordinates}\index{Minkowskian!coordinates})
is
\be \label{e:glo:Mink_metric}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = - \D t^2 + \D x^2 + \D y^2 + \D z^2 .
\ee

\subsection{Finite-range coordinates on Minkowski spacetime}

Since we would like to deal with the ``far'' region, it is natural to introduce
$r := \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ and the associated spherical coordinates
$(x^\alpha) = (t,r,\th,\ph)$, which are related to the Minkowskian ones by
\be
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    x = r\sin\th\cos\ph \\
    y = r\sin\th\sin\ph \\
    z = r\cos\th .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
The coordinates $(t, r,\th,\ph)$ span
$\mathbb{R}\times(0,+\infty)\times (0,\pi) \times (0,2\pi)$; they do not cover
the whole manifold $\M$ as a regular chart (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:def_manif} of Appendix~\ref{s:bas}), but only $\M\setminus \Pi$, where $\Pi$ is the closed half hyperplane defined
by $y=0$ and $x\geq 0$. Once expressed in terms of the
spherical coordinates, the Minkowski metric (\ref{e:glo:Mink_metric}) takes the form
\be
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = - \D t^2 + \D r^2
        + r^2 \left( \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{glo_null_coord.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:null_coord} \footnotesize
Lines of constant null coordinates $u$ (dashed) and $v$
(solid) in terms of the coordinates $(t,r)$.}
\end{figure}


Let us introduce the null coordinate system $(u,v,\th,\ph)$ where $u$ and
$v$ are respectively the retarted\index{retarted!time} and advanced\index{advanced!time}
time defined by (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:null_coord})
\be \label{e:glo:advanced_retarded}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    u = t - r\\
    v = t + r
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    t = \frac{1}{2} (v+u)\\[1ex]
    r = \frac{1}{2} (v-u) .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
The metric tensor takes then the shape
\be \label{e:glo:Mink_metric_uv}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = - \D u \, \D v
        + \frac{1}{4} (v-u)^2 \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee
The coordinates $(u,v)$ span the half part of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by
$u<v$. In order to have coordinates within a finite range, let us consider
their arctangents (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:atan}):
\be \label{e:glo:UV_uv}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    U = \arctan u \\
    V = \arctan v
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
   \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    u = \tan U \\
    v = \tan V .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
Then the coordinates $(U,V)$ span the half part of $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)\times (-\pi/2, \pi/2)$
defined by $U < V$
(since $\arctan$ is a monotonically increasing function, cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:atan}):
\be \label{e:glo:span_UV}
    -\frac{\pi}{2} < U < \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad
    -\frac{\pi}{2} < V < \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad\mbox{and}\quad U < V.
\ee

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{glo_atan.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:atan} \footnotesize
The arctangent function mapping $\mathbb{R}$ to $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$.}
\end{figure}

Since
\[
    \D u = \frac{\D U}{\cos^2 U}, \quad \D v = \frac{\D V}{\cos^2 V}
    \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \tan V - \tan U = \frac{\sin(V-U)}{\cos U \cos V},
\]
the Minkowski metric (\ref{e:glo:Mink_metric_uv})
is expressed in terms of the coordinates $(x^\alpha)=(U,V,\th,\ph)$
as\footnote{See also Sec.~\ref{s:sam:worksheets} for the computation
with SageManifolds.}
\be \label{e:glo:g_UV}
    g_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu = \frac{1}{4\cos^2 U \cos^2 V}
    \left[ - 4 \D U \, \D V + \sin^2(V-U) \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right)
    \right] .
\ee

\subsection{Conformal metric}

In the right-hand side of (\ref{e:glo:g_UV}),
the terms in square brackets defines a metric
$\w{\tilde{g}}$ such that
\be \label{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}
    \encadre{ \w{\tilde{g}} = \Omega^2 \w{g} } ,
\ee
where $\Omega$ is the scalar field $\M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ obeying
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \Omega & =  2 \cos U \cos V \label{e:glo:Omega_UV} \\
           & =  \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+v^2}} \label{e:glo:Omega_uv}\\
           & =  \frac{2}{\sqrt{(t-r)^2+1}\sqrt{(t+r)^2+1}} . \label{e:glo:Omega_tr}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
We notice on (\ref{e:glo:Omega_uv}) and (\ref{e:glo:Omega_tr}) that the function
$\Omega$ never vanishes on $\M$, so that the bilinear form $\w{\tilde{g}}$ defined by
(\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}) constitutes a well behaved metric on $\M$.
Moreover, since $\Omega^2 > 0$, $\w{\tilde{g}}$ has the same signature as
$\w{g}$, i.e. $(-,+,+,+)$.
The specific expression of $\w{\tilde{g}}$ is deduced from (\ref{e:glo:g_UV})
and (\ref{e:glo:Omega_UV}):
\be \label{e:glo:tg_UV}
    \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu =  - 4 \D U \, \D V
        + \sin^2(V-U) \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee

In view of (\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}), one says that the metric $\w{\tilde{g}}$
is \defin{conformal to}\index{conformal} the metric $\w{g}$, or equivalently,
that the metrics $\w{g}$ and $\w{\tilde{g}}$ are
\defin{conformally related}\index{conformally related metrics},
or that $\w{\tilde{g}}$ arises from $\w{g}$ via a
\defin{conformal transformation}\index{conformal!transformation}.
The scalar field $\Omega$ is called the \defin{conformal factor}\index{conformal!factor}.

A key property of a conformal transformation is to preserve the orthogonality
relations, since (\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}) clearly
implies, at any point $p\in\M$,
\[
    \forall (\w{u},\w{v})\in T_p\M\times T_p\M,\quad
    \w{\tilde{g}}(\w{u},\w{v}) = 0 \iff \w{g}(\w{u},\w{v}) = 0 .
\]
In particular, null vectors for $\w{\tilde{g}}$ coincide with null vectors for $\w{g}$:
\[
    \forall \wl \in T_p\M,\quad
    \w{\tilde{g}}(\wl,\wl) = 0 \iff \w{g}(\wl,\wl) = 0 .
\]
Consequently the light cones of $(\M,\w{g})$ and $(\M,\w{\tilde{g}})$
are identical.
Moreover, since $\Omega^2>0$, the spacelike and timelike characters of vectors
is preserved as well:
\be
    \begin{array}{ll}
    \forall \w{v} \in T_p\M,\ &
        \w{v} \mbox{\ spacelike for\ } \w{\tilde{g}} \iff \w{v} \mbox{\ spacelike for\ } \w{g} \\
    & \w{v} \mbox{\ timelike for\ } \w{\tilde{g}} \iff \w{v} \mbox{\ timelike for\ } \w{g} .
    \end{array}
\ee
It follows that a curve $\Li$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{\tilde{g}}$
iff $\Li$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{g}$. Similarly,
a hypersurface $\Sigma$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{\tilde{g}}$
iff $\Li$ is timelike (resp. null, spacelike) for $\w{g}$.

What about geodesics? Let us first recall that a null curve is not necessarily
a null geodesic (cf. Remark~\ref{r:def:null_curves} on page~\pageref{r:def:null_curves}),
so that one cannot deduce from the above results that conformal transformations
preserve null geodesics. However, this turns out to be true:
\begin{quote}
A smooth curve $\Li$ in $\M$ is a null geodesic for $\w{\tilde{g}}$ iff
$\Li$ is a null geodesic for $\w{g}$.
\end{quote}
To prove it, it suffices to write explicitly the geodesic equation
and to express the Christoffel symbols of $\w{\tilde{g}}$ in terms of those
of $\w{g}$ and the derivatives of $\Omega$ (see e.g. Appendix~D of Wald's
textbook \cite{Wald84} for details).

On the contrary conformal transformations preserve neither the timelike
geodesics nor the spacelike ones.

The coordinates $(U,V)$ are of null type; let us consider instead
the ``time+space'' coordinates $(\tau,\chi)$ defined by\footnote{Notice the
similarity with (\ref{e:glo:advanced_retarded}) up to some $1/2$ factors.}
\be \label{e:glo:tau_chi_U_V}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    \tau = V + U \\
    \chi = V - U
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    U = \frac{1}{2} (\tau - \chi) \\[1ex]
    V = \frac{1}{2} (\tau + \chi) .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
Given (\ref{e:glo:span_UV}), the range of these new coordinates is
\be \label{e:glo:range_tau_chi}
    0 < \chi < \pi \quad\mbox{and}\quad
    \chi - \pi < \tau < \pi - \chi .
\ee
In other words, if we draw the Minkowski spacetime in the $(\tau,\chi)$ plane,
it takes the shape of a half-diamond: see Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{glo_conf_diag_Mink.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink} \footnotesize
Conformal diagram of Minkowski spacetime. Constant-$r$ curves are drawn in
red, while constant-$t$ ones are drawn in grey.}
\end{figure}

By combining (\ref{e:glo:advanced_retarded}) (\ref{e:glo:UV_uv}) and
(\ref{e:glo:tau_chi_U_V}), we get the link between $(t,r)$ and
$(\tau,\chi)$:
\be \label{e:glo:tau_chi_t_r}
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    \tau = \arctan(t+r) + \arctan(t-r) \\
    \chi = \arctan(t+r) - \arctan(t-r)
    \end{array} \right.
    \iff
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    \displaystyle t = \frac{\sin\tau}{\cos\tau + \cos\chi}\\[2ex]
    \displaystyle r = \frac{\sin\chi}{\cos\tau + \cos\chi} .
    \end{array} \right.
\ee
We may use these relations to draw the lines $t=\mathrm{const}$ and
$r=\mathrm{const}$ in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}.

The expression of the conformal factor in the
coordinates $(\tau,\chi,\th,\ph)$ is easily deduced from
(\ref{e:glo:Omega_UV}) and
(\ref{e:glo:tau_chi_U_V}):
\be \label{e:glo:Omega_tau_chi}
    \Omega = \cos\tau + \cos\chi .
\ee


\subsection{Conformal completion}

The expression of the conformal metric in terms of the coordinates
$(x^\alpha) = (\tau,\chi,\th,\ph)$ is easily deduced from that in terms of
$(U,V,\th,\ph)$ as given by (\ref{e:glo:tg_UV}):
\be \label{e:glo:tg_Einstein}
    \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \D x^\mu \D x^\nu =  - \D\tau^2
        + \D \chi^2
        + \sin^2\chi \left(  \D\th^2 + \sin^2\th \, \D\ph^2 \right) .
\ee
Restricting to a $\tau = \mathrm{const}$ hypersurface, i.e. setting $\D\tau=0$,
we recognize the standard metric of the hypersphere
$\mathbb{S}^3$ in the hyperspherical coordinates $(\chi,\th,\ph)$.
Moreover, we notice that the full metric (\ref{e:glo:tg_Einstein})
is perfectly regular even if we relax
the condition on $\tau$ in (\ref{e:glo:range_tau_chi}), i.e. if we
let $\tau$ span the
entire $\mathbb{R}$. We may then consider the manifold
\be
    \mathscr{E} = \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{S}^3
\ee
and $\w{\tilde{g}}$ as a Lorentzian metric on $\mathscr{E}$ given by
(\ref{e:glo:tg_Einstein}).
The Lorentzian manifold
$(\mathscr{E},\w{\tilde{g}})$ is nothing but the
\defin{Einstein static universe}\index{Einstein!static universe}\index{static!universe (Einstein)}, also called the \defin{Einstein cylinder}\index{Einstein!cylinder}\index{cylinder!Einstein --},
a static solution of the Einstein equation (\ref{e:bas:Einstein_eq})
with $\Lambda > 0$ and some pressureless matter of uniform density
$\rho = \Lambda/(4\pi)$.
We have thus an embedding\footnote{Cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:embed} of Appendix~A} of Minkowski spacetime into the Einstein cylinder:
\be \label{e:glo:embed_Mink_Einst}
     \Phi:\ \M \longrightarrow \mathscr{E}
\ee
and this embedding is a conformal isometry from
$(\M,\w{g})\rightarrow (\Phi(\M),\w{\tilde{g}})$.
In the following, we shall identify $\Phi(\M)$ and $\M$, i.e. use the same
symbol $\M$ to denote the subset of $\mathscr{E}$ that is the image of $\M$ via the
embedding (\ref{e:glo:embed_Mink_Einst}).

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{glo_Einstcyl_Mink.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink}\footnotesize
Two views of the Einstein cylinder $\mathscr{E}$, with the conformal embedding of
Minkowski spacetime in it.
The red curves are the same constant-$r$ curves
as in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}, while the black curves are
the same constant-$t$ curves as those drawn in grey in Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}.}
\end{figure}

Since $\mathscr{E}$ and $\M$ have the same dimension, $\M$ is an open subset of $\mathscr{E}$.
Its closure $\overline{\M}$ in $\mathscr{E}$ is (cf.
Figs.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink} and \ref{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink})
\be
    \overline{\M} = \M \cup \scri^+ \cup \scri^- \cup \left\{ i^0 \right\} \cup
            \left\{ i^+ \right\} \cup \left\{ i^- \right\} ,
\ee
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\scri^+$ is the hypersurface of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by
$\tau = \pi - \chi$ and $0 < \tau < \pi$;
\item $\scri^-$ is the hypersurface of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by
$\tau = \chi - \pi $ and $-\pi  < \tau < 0$;
\item $i^0$ is the point of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by $\tau=0$ and $\chi=\pi$;
\item $i^+$ is the point of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by $\tau=\pi$ and $\chi=0$;
\item $i^-$ is the point of $\mathscr{E}$ defined by $\tau=-\pi$ and $\chi=0$.
\end{itemize}
It is customary to pronounce $\scri$ as ``scri'', for \emph{script i}.

\begin{remark}
On $\mathbb{S}^3$, the hyperspherical coordinates $(\chi,\th,\ph)$
are singular at $\chi=0$ and $\chi=\pi$, so that setting $\chi=0$ (or $\chi=\pi$)
defines a unique point of $\mathbb{S}^3$, whatever the value of $(\th,\ph)$.
Note also that the vertical left boundary of the daimond drawn in
Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}, i.e. the segment defined by
$\tau\in(-\pi,\pi)$ and $\chi=0$, is \emph{not} a part of the boundary
of $\M$ but merely reflect the coordinate singularity at $\chi=0$, in the same
way that the left vertical boundary of Fig.~\ref{f:glo:null_coord}
is not a boundary of Minkowski spacetime but is
due to the coordinate singularity at $r=0$. Note by the way that
$\chi=0$ implies $r=0$ via (\ref{e:glo:tau_chi_t_r}).
\end{remark}

Let
\be
    \scri := \scri^+ \cup \scri^-
\ee
and
\be
    \tilde{\M} := \M \cup \scri .
\ee
$\tilde{\M}$ is naturally a smooth manifold with boundary\index{manifold!with boundary}
and its boundary is $\scri$:
\be
    \partial \tilde{\M} = \scri.
\ee
\begin{remark}
Because closure $\overline{\M}$ is self-intersecting at the point $i^0$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink}), it is not a manifold with boundary: no open neighbourhood of
$i^0$ is homeomorphic to a neighbourhood of $[0,+\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^2$.
At the points $i^+$ and $i^-$, $\overline{\M}$ can be considered as a
topological manifold with boundary, but not as a \emph{smooth} manifold with boundary.
Hence the three points $i^0$, $i^+$ and $i^-$ are excluded from the definition
of the manifold with boundary $\tilde{\M}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{glo_conf_Mink_null.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}\footnotesize
Null radial geodesics in the conformal diagram of Minkowski spacetime.
The dashed green lines are null geodesics $u=\mathrm{const}$ for
17 values of $u$ uniformly spanning $[-8,8]$, while the solid green lines are
null geodesics $v=\mathrm{const}$ for 17 values of $v$ uniformly spanning $[-8,8]$.}
\end{figure}

The hypersurface $\scri^+$ is the location of $\tilde{\M}$ where all radial null geodesics
terminate, while $\scri^-$ is the location of $\tilde{\M}$ where all these geodesics orginate (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}). For this
reason $\scri^+$ is called the
\defin{future null infinity}\index{future!null infinity}\index{null!infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$
and $\scri^-$ the \defin{past null infinity}\index{past!null infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$.
On the other side, any timelike geodesic of $(\M,\w{g})$ orginates at $i\-$ and ends at
$i^+$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink}), while any spacelike geodesic
of $(\M,\w{g})$ originates at $i^0$ and terminates there
(after having completed a closed path on $\mathbb{S}^3$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Einstcyl_Mink}).
The point $i^+$ is then called the
\defin{future timelike infinity}\index{future!timelike infinity}\index{timelike!infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$,
$i\-$ the \defin{past timelike infinity}\index{past!timelike infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$
and $i^0$ the \defin{spacelike infinity}\index{spacelike!infinity} of $(\M,\w{g})$.

As it is clear on the conformal diagram of Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_diag_Mink},
both $\scri^+$ and $\scri^-$ are null hypersurfaces of $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$.

\begin{figure}

It is precisely because $\Omega$ vanishes (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Omega_Mink}) at the boundary
\be
    \overline{\M} \setminus \M = \scri^+ \cup \scri^- \cup \left\{ i^0 \right\} \cup
            \left\{ i^+ \right\} \cup \left\{ i^- \right\}
\ee
that the conformal transformation (\ref{e:glo:tilde_g_Omega}) brings infinity
of Minkowski space to a finite distance.

\section{Conformal completions and asymptotic flatness} \label{s:glo:conf_compl}

Having investigated the asymptotic structure of Minkowski spacetime
via a conformal completion, let us use the latter to define spacetimes
that ``look like'' Minkowski spacetime asymptotically: we
shall say that a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ admits a
\defin{conformal completion}\index{conformal!completion}
iff there exists a Lorentzian manifold with boundary
$(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ equipped with a smooth non-negative scalar field
$\Omega: \tilde{\M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\tilde{\M} = \M \cup \scri$, with $\scri := \partial \tilde{\M}$
(the boundary of $\tilde{\M})$;
\item on $\M$, $\w{\tilde{g}} = \Omega^2 \w{g}$;
\item on $\scri$, $\Omega=0$;
\item on $\scri$, $\dd \Omega \not= 0$;
\end{enumerate}
Condition~1 expresses that $\M$ has been endowed with some boundary.
A rigorous formulation of it would be via an embedding $\Phi:\M \rightarrow \tilde{\M}$,
as in Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:embed_Mink_Einst}), so that
$\tilde{\M} = \Phi(\M) \cup \scri$. However, as above, we identify $\Phi(\M)$
with $\M$ and therefore simply write $\tilde{\M} = \M \cup \scri$.
Conditions~2 and 3 express that the boundary of $\M$ has been brought to a
finite distance with respect to $\w{\tilde{g}}$. Finally, condition~4 ensures
that $\scri$ is a regular hypersurface of $\tilde{\M}$.
It is of course fullfilled by Minkowski spacetime, as we can check graphically
on Fig.~\ref{f:glo:Omega_Mink}: the graph of $\Omega$ has no horizontal slope
at $\scri$.

\begin{remark}
When we say that $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ is a Lorentzian manifold with
boundary, this implies that $\w{\tilde{g}}$ is smooth everywhere on $\tilde{\M}$,
including at the boundary $\scri$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[comformal completion of AdS$_{n}$ spacetime]
... to be completed ...
\end{example}

Furthermore, one says that $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$ is a
\defin{conformal completion at null infinity}\index{conformal!completion!at null infinity}
of $(\M,\w{g})$
iff $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$  is a conformal completion such that
\be
    \scri = \scri^+ \cup \scri^-,
\ee
with $\scri^+$ (resp. $\scri^-$) being never intersected by any past-directed
(resp. future-directed) causal
curve originating in $\M$. Let us recall that a
\defin{causal curve}\index{causal!curve} is
curve whose tangent vectors are nowhere spacelike.

\begin{remark}
One often speaks about \emph{conformal compactification}\index{conformal!compactification}
instead of \emph{conformal completion}, but in general $\tilde{\M}$ is not a
compact manifold. For instance, because we omitted the points $i^+$, $i^-$ and $i^0$,
$\tilde{\M}$ is not compact even for Minkowski spacetime.
\end{remark}

Penrose \cite{Penro64,Penro68} has defined
a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ to be \defin{asymptotically simple}\index{asymptotically!simple} iff there exists
a conformal completion $(\tilde{\M},\w{\tilde{g}})$
of $(\M,\w{g})$
such that every null geodesic in $\M$ has two endpoints in $\scri$.

The last condition, which is verified by Minkowski spacetime (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}), is rather restrictive. In particular, it excludes
black hole spacetimes, since, almost by definition, the latter contain null
geodesics that have no endpoint on $\scri^+$, having only a past endpoint
on $\scri^-$, as far as $\scri$ is concerned. To cope with these spacetimes,
Penrose \cite{Penro68} has introduced the following definition:
a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is
\defin{weakly asymptotically simple}\index{weakly!asymptotically simple} iff
there exists an open subset $\mathscr{U}$ of $\M$ and
an asymptotically simple spacetime $(\M_0, \w{g}_0)$
with an open neighbourhood $\mathscr{U}_0$ of $\scri_0 = \partial \tilde{\M}_0$
in $\tilde{\M}_0$ such that $(\mathscr{U}_0\cap \M_0,\w{g}_0)$ is
isometric to $(\mathscr{U},\w{g})$.

\begin{remark}
For a given weakly asymptotically simple spacetime, there may be different
(non overlaping) regions $\mathscr{U}$ satisfying the above property.
For instance we shall see in Chap.~\ref{s:ker}
that there are an infinite series of them in the Kerr spacetime.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Causal structure preliminaries}

Before we proceed to the precise definition of a black hole, let us introduce
some concepts regarding the causal structure of a given spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$.
For any subset $S$ of $\M$, we define
\begin{itemize}
\item the \defin{chronological future of $S$}\index{chronological!future} as the set $I^+(S)$ of all
points of $\M$ that can be reached from a point of $S$ by a future-directed
timelike curve of nonzero extent;
\item the \defin{causal future of $S$}\index{causal!future} as the set $J^+(S)$ of
all points that either are in $S$ or can be reached from a point of $S$ by a future-directed
causal curve;
\item the \defin{chronological past of $S$}\index{chronological!past} as the set $I^-(S)$ of all
points of $\M$ that can be reached from a point of $S$ by a past-directed
timelike curve of nonzero extent;
\item the \defin{causal past of $S$}\index{causal!past} as the set $J^-(S)$ of
all points that either are in $S$ or can be reached from a point of $S$ by a past-directed
causal curve.
\end{itemize}
From the above definitions, one has always $S \subset J^\pm(S)$ and
$I^\pm(S) \subset J^\pm(S)$.

\begin{remark}
One has not necessarily $S \subset I^\pm(S)$. For instance,
if the spacetime does not contain
any closed timelike curve, one has  $S \cap I^\pm(S) = \varnothing$ for
$S = \{p\}$, $p$ being any point of $\M$.
\end{remark}

Here are some basic topological properties of the future and past sets
defined above (see e.g. \S~6.2 of \cite{HawkiE73} or Chap.~14 of
\cite{ONeil83} for a demonstration):
$I^\pm(S)$ is always an open subset of $\M$ and its closure contains
$J^\pm(S)$: $J^\pm(S) \subset \overline{I^\pm(S)}$, with equality iff
$J^\pm(S)$ is closed. The interior of $J^\pm(S)$ is $I^\pm(S)$
and both sets have the same boundary:
\be
    \partial J^\pm(S) = \partial I^\pm(S).
\ee

\subsection{General definition} \label{s:glo:def_BH}

We are now in position to give the general definition of a black hole.
We shall do it for spacetimes $(\M,\w{g})$ that admit a conformal completion
at null infinity as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_compl}, i.e. that
posseses a future null infinity $\scri^+$. The neighbourhood of $\scri^+$
in $\tilde{\M}$ can then be considered as the asymptotically flat far region
reached by outgoing null geodesics. If a null geodesic does not reach this
region, it can be considered as being trapped somewhere else in spacetime: this
place would constitute a black hole region.


The \defin{black hole region}\index{black!hole}, or simply \defin{black hole}, of a
spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ with a conformal completion at null infinity is
the set of points of $\M$ that are not in the causal past of the future null infinity:
\be
    \encadre{\mathscr{B} := \M \setminus (J^-(\scri^+)\cap\M) } .
\ee
The black hole region is thus the set of points of $\M$
from which no future-directed causal curve in $\tilde{\M}$ reaches $\scri^+$.
Of course, it may be that $\mathscr{B} = \varnothing$, in which case one
says that the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ contains no black hole.
\begin{example}
The Minkowski spacetime has no black hole, for all future-directed null geodesics
terminate at $\scri^+$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:conf_Mink_null}).
More generally, any asymptotically simple spacetime has no black hole.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
Some authors (in particular Hawking and Ellis \cite{HawkiE73}) define a
\emph{black hole} as a connected component of
$S(\tau) \cap \mathscr{B}$, where $S(\tau)$ is a spacelike
hypersurface that intersects $\scri^+$ and
is a slice of the future development of a partial Cauchy hypersurface $S(0)$.
In such a definition, a black hole is then a $(n-1)$-dimensional object,
while the black hole $\mathscr{B}$ defined above is $n$-dimensional object.
\end{remark}

If $\mathscr{B}\not=\varnothing$, the boundary $\Hor$ of the black hole region
is called the \defin{future event horizon}\index{future!event horizon}
(or simply the \defin{event horizon}\index{event!horizon}
when no ambiguity may arise):
\be
    \encadre{\Hor := \partial \mathscr{B}}.
\ee
Note that $\Hor$ is the part of the boundary of the causal past of
$\scri^+$ that lies in $\M$:
\be
    \Hor = \M \cap \partial J^-(\scri^+)
\ee

In a way symmetric to the black hole one, one defines
the \defin{white hole region}\index{white!hole} of a
spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ with a conformal completion at null infinity as the
complement within $\M$ of the causal future of the past null infinity:
\be
    \encadre{\mathscr{W} := \M \setminus (J^+(\scri^-)\cap \M) } .
\ee
The white hole region is thus the set of points of $\M$
from which no past-directed causal curve in $\tilde{\M}$ reaches $\scri^-$.
The boundary of white hole region is called the
\defin{past event horizon}\index{past!event horizon}:
\be
    \encadre{\Hor^- := \partial \mathscr{B}} .
\ee

The \defin{domain of outer communications}\index{domain!of outer communications}
is the part $\langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$ of $\M$ that lies neither
in the black hole region nor in the white hole one:
\be
    \langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle := \M\setminus (\Hor\cup \mathscr{W} )
            = \left( J^-(\scri^+) \cap J^+(\scri^-) \right) \cap \M .
\ee
The last equality, which is a direct consequence of the definitions of
$\Hor$ and $\mathscr{W}$, shows that the domain of outer communications
is the set of points from which it is possible to send a signal to and to
receive a signal from arbitrary far regions.
It also follows immediately from the definitions of the two event horizons
that the boundary of the domain of outer communications is their union:
\be
    \partial \langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle  = \Hor \cup \Hor^- .
\ee

\begin{hist}
The term \emph{event horizon} has been introduced by W.~Rindler in 1956 \cite{Rindl56}
in the context of a single observer moving in some cosmological spacetime.
The word \emph{black hole} has been coined by J.A.~Wheeler in the end of 1967,
from a suggestion shouted from the audience during one of his conference.
It superseded the previous names
\emph{frozen star}, \emph{collapsed star}, or \emph{astre occlus}
(the latter appearing along \emph{black holes} in the title of
the proceedings of the famous Les Houches summer school of 1972 \cite{DeWit73}).
The expression \emph{domain of outer communications} is due to B.~Carter
(1971) \cite{Carte71}.
\end{hist}


\subsection{Properties of the future event horizon} \label{s:glo:properties_H}

Having defined the black hole in full generality, let us discuss the
main properties of its boundary, the event horizon $\Hor$.

\subsubsection{Property 1:}
\begin{quote}
$\Hor$ is an \defin{achronal set}\index{achronal set}, i.e. no pair of points of $\Hor$ can be connected
by a timelike curve of $\M$.
\end{quote}

Note that in the definition of an achronal set, it is not demanded that the timelike
curve lies entirely in the set (the set can even be discrete, so that no curve
lies in it). Accordingly,
an equivalent statement of Property~1 is: no timelike curve of $\M$
encounters $\Hor$ at more than one point.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{glo_achronal.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:achronal} \footnotesize
Proving that $\Hor$ is achronal.}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Let us assume the negation of Property~1, i.e. that there exists two points
in $\Hor$ which are connected by a timelike curve $\Li$. Let us call $p$ and
$q$ these two points, with $q$ in the future of $p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:achronal}).
We shall then use the following property:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Lemma 1}: One can ``move the ends'' of any timelike curve
``a little bit'' and still get a timelike curve. More precisely,
if two points $p,q\in\M$ are connected by a timelike curve,
there exists
a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ and a neighbourhood $V$ of $q$ such that
any point $p'\in U$ can be connected to any point $q'\in V$ by a timelike curve.
\begin{proof}
This is more or less evident on a spacetime diagram (cf. Fig.~??)
and a formal proof
can be found as Lemma~3
in Chap.~14 of O'Neill's textbook \cite{ONeil83}.
\end{proof}
Applying Lemma~1,
let us choose $p'\in U\cap\mathscr{B}$ and $q'\in V\cap J^-(\scri^+)$. Such a choice is
always possible since $p$ and $q$ lie on the boundary between $\mathscr{B}$
and $J^-(\scri^+)$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:achronal}).
Since $q'\in J^-(\scri^+)$, the timelike curve linking $p'$ and $q'$ can then be extended in the future into a causal curve $\Li'$ reaching $\scri^+$. This implies $p'\in J^-(\scri^+)$,
which contradicts $p'\in\mathscr{B}$.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Property 2:}
\begin{quote}
$\Hor$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n-1$, $n$ being the spacetime
dimension.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{glo_hor_manifold.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:glo:hor_manifold} \footnotesize
Proving that $\Hor$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n-1$.}
\end{figure}


\begin{proof}
Let $p\in\Hor$ and $U$ some open neighbourhood of $p$ where one can define
a normal coordinate system $(x^\alpha)$. We have then $\wpar_0$ timelike,
$\wpar_i$ spacelike for $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and $\w{g}(\wpar_0, \wpar_i) = 0$.
Let us consider a curve in $U$ defined by $x^1 = a_1$,..., $x^{n-1} = a_{n-1}$,
where $a_1$, ..., $a_{n-1}$ are $n-1$ constants.
This curve is timelike, since a tangent vector is $\wpar_0$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:glo:hor_manifold}).
It therefore intersects $\Hor$ at a single point $q$, for $\Hor$ is achronal (Property~1).
Let us then give the coordinates $(y^i) = (a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ to $q$.
By varying $(a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1})$, we get a homeomorphism from $U\cap\Hor$
to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Property 3 (Penrose 1968 \cite{Penro68}):}
\begin{quote}
$\Hor$ is ruled by a family of null geodesics that (i) either lie entirely
in $\Hor$ or at least never leave $\Hor$ when followed into the future from the
point where they first touched $\Hor$, and
(ii) have no endpoint in the future. Moreover, there is exactly one null
geodesic through each point of $\Hor$, except at special points called
\defin{caustics}\index{caustic}, which are the only points
where a null geodesic can enter in $\Hor$.
\end{quote}
In particular, once a null geodesic has
entered $\Hor$ at a caustic (where it may intersect other null geodesics),
it will stay forever on $\Hor$ and will never intersect any other null geodesic
of the family ruling $\Hor$. These null geodesics are called the
\defin{generators of}\index{generator!of an event horizon} $\Hor$.

\begin{proof}
The following proof is adapted from that presented in Box~34.1 of MTW \cite{MisneTW73}.
It relies on the following lemma:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Lemma~2:} Let $\Li$ be a causal curve connecting two points $p$ and $q$
of $\M$. If $\Li$ contains a timelike segment, then there exists an
entirely timelike curve connecting $p$ and $q$.
\begin{proof}
We shall provide only a graphical ``proof'', based on the spacetime diagram
of Fig.~??. The parts of $\Li$ may have parts where it is null, where it is drawn with
an angle of incline $\theta = \pm 45^\circ$ in Fig.~??.
If $\Li$ contains a timelike segment, i.e. a segment with $|\theta|>45^\circ$,
it can be deformed, while keeping the same ends, to a curve with $|\theta|>45^\circ$
everywhere, i.e. to a timelike curve.
\end{proof}

Let $p\in\Hor$ and let $U$ be some convex open neighbourhood of $p$.
Since $p$ lies in the boundary of $J^-(\scri^+)$, it is always possible to
consider
a sequence of points $(p_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converging towards $p$
such that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},\ p_n \in U \cap J^-(\scri^+)$.
Since $p_n\in J^-(\scri^+)$,
there exists a future-directed causal curve $\Li_{n}$ from $p_n$ to $\scri^+$
for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
Since $U$ is convex, each $\Li_n$ intersects its boundary $\partial U$
at a unique point, $q_n$ say: $\{q_n\}=\Li_n \cap \partial U$ (cf. Fig.~??).
Since $\partial U$
is compact, the sequence $(q_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ admits a subsequence,
$(q_{f(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ say (where $f$ is an increasing
function $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$),
that converges to some limit point $q$.
Since from any point $p_{f(n)}$ arbitrary close to $p$, there is a causal curve
$\Li_{f(n)}$ to the $q_{f(n)}$ arbitrary close to $q$, one can show that
there exist a causal curve $\Li$ connecting $p$ to $q$ (see e.g.
Lemma~6.2.1 of Hawking \& Ellis textbook \cite{HawkiE73}
for a precise demonstration).

As the limit of points in $J^-(\scri^+)$, $q$ is in the closure
$\overline{J^-(\scri^+)} = J^-(\scri^+) \cup \Hor$, $\Hor$
being the boundary of $J^-(\scri^+)$.
Let us show by contradiction that actually $q\in\Hor$.
If we assume $q\not\in\Hor$, then necessarily $q\in J^-(\scri^+)$.
There exists then an open neighbourhood $V$ of $q$ such that $V \subset  J^-(\scri+)$.
Let us choose $q'\in V$ such that $q$ is connected to $q'$ via a timelike curve.
We may then extend $\Li$ to a causal curve $\tilde{\Li}$ from $p$ to $\scri^+$
via $q$ and $q'$ (cf. Fig.~??). Since $\tilde{\Li}$ contains a timelike segment
(between $q$ and $q'$), we may invoke Lemma~2 to deform it into
a timelike curve $\tilde{\Li}'$ between $p$ and $\scri^+$. Then, by Lemma~1,
one can ``move the end'' of $\tilde{\Li}'$
to get a new timelike curve linking an event $p'\in\mathscr{B}$ close
to $p$ to $\scri^+$, which is impossible by the very definition of the black hole
region $\mathscr{B}$. Hence we have that $q\in\Hor$.

The causal curve $\Li$ connecting $p$ to $q$ cannot be timelike since
$p$ and $q$ are both in $\Hor$, which is achronal (Property~1).
If $\Li$ would contain a timelike segment, then by Lemma~2, it could
be deformed into a timelike curve between $p$ and $q$, which again would
contradict the achronal character of $\Hor$. Hence $\Li$ is necessarily a null
curve. If it would not be a null geodesic, it would not have an extremum length
between all curves connecting $p$ and $q$ (the length being defined as
the integral of the scalar square $\D s^2 = \w{g}(\D\w{x}, \D\w{x})$
of the displacement vector $\D\w{x}$ along the curve).
The length of $\Li$ being zero, there would then exists some curves of negative
length connecting $p$ and $q$. Since such curves are timelike, this
would be in contradiction with the achronal character of $\Hor$.

At this stage, we have shown that given $p\in\Hor$, there exists
a future-directed null geodesic $\Li$ connecting $p$ to another point $q\in\Hor$.
There remains to show that $\Li$ lies entirely in $\Hor$.
Let us start by showing that $\Li\subset \overline{J^-(\scri^+)}$.
Let $a$ be a generic point of $\Li$ between $p$ and $q$. There exists a point
$a'$ arbitrary close to $a$ such that $a'$ is connected to $q$ by a
future-directed timelike curve (cf. Fig.~??). Thanks to Lemma~1, we may
find a point $q'\in J^-(\scri^+)$ close to $q$ such that $a'$ is connected
to $q'$ by a future-directed timelike curve. But then such curve can be extended
to a causal curve to $\scri^+$ since $q'\in J^-(\scri^+)$ and we have that
$a'\in  J^-(\scri^+)$. Since $a'$ is arbitrary close to $a$, we conclude
that $a\in\overline{J^-(\scri^+)}$. $a$ being a generic point of $\Li$, we have
shown in fact that $\Li\subset \overline{J^-(\scri^+)} = J^-(\scri^+)\cup \Hor$.
Now it is easy to show that any point $a$ of $\Li$ actually lies in $\Hor$
by repeating exactling the same reasoning as that employed above to show that
$q\in\Hor$, by replacing $q$ by $a$. We therefore conclude that
$\Li$ lies entirely in $\Hor$.

Given a point $p\in\Hor$, we have thus constructed a
future-directed null geodesic $\Li$ lying entirely in $\Hor$ and
connecting $p$ to another point $q\in\Hor$. One can
repeat the construction
from the point $q$ to get another future-directed null geodesic $\Li'\subset\Hor$
connecting $q$ to another point $q'\in\Hor$. Now $\Li$ and $\Li'$ must have
be two segments of the same null geodesic $\Li\cup\Li'$ by the following lemma:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Lemma~3}: If from a point $q\in\Hor$, there exists a past-directed
null geodesic $\Li\subset\Hor$ and a future-directed null geodesic $\Li'\subset\Hor$,
then necessarily $\Li$ and $\Li'$ have collinear tangent vectors at their common point $q$.
It follows that $\Li$ (with a time-reversed parametrization) and $\Li'$ are two segments
of a same null geodesic through $q$.
\begin{proof}
Assume $\Li$ and $\Li'$ have non-collinear tangent vectors at $q$. Then, in
the vicinity of $q$, one can find a point $a\in\Li$ and a point $b\in\Li'$
such that $a$ and $b$ can be connected by a timelike curve (cf.
Fig.~??). Since $\Li\subset\Hor$ and $\Li'\subset\Hor$, we have $a\in\Hor$ and
$b\in\Hor$ and therefore we get a contradiction with $\Hor$ being achronal.
\end{proof}
Thanks to Lemma~3, we conclude that $\Li'$ extends $\Li$ to null geodesic
$\Li\cup\Li'$ entirely lying in $\Hor$. By iterating, we conclude that
the null geodesic $\Li$ through $p$ can be extended indefinitely into the
future. Moreover, it can never leave $\Hor$. Indeed, if it leaves $\Hor$ at
some point $q$, by the same procedure used above for $p$, one could construct a future-directed null geodesic
$\Li'\subset\Hor$ starting from $q$ and Lemma~3 would imply that
the extension of $\Li$ outside $\Hor$ has to coincide with $\Li'$, which is
in contradiction with $\Li'\subset\Hor$.

Another direct consequence of Lemma~3 is that no two distinct null generators
may intersect at a point $p\in\Hor$, except if their segments in the past of
$p$ lie outside $\Hor$.
This completes the proof of Property~3.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Property 4:}
\begin{quote}
Wherever it is smooth, $\Hor$ is a null hypersurface.
\end{quote}
\begin{proof}
Let us assume that $\Hor$ is smooth in some open subset $U$.
By Property~2, $\Hor$ is then a smooth hypersurface in $U$.
According to Property~3, there are null geodesic lying in $\Hor$ through
any point of $\Hor\cap U$.
This implies null tangent vectors to $\Hor$, so that $\Hor$ must be either
a null hypersurface or a timelike one. But $\Hor$ is achronal by Property~1;
it therefore cannot be timelike. Hence $\Hor$ is a null hypersurface in $U$.
\end{proof}
The generators of $\Hor$, as defined in Property~3, are then nothing but the
null-hypersurface generators as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:def:geod_gener}.

\begin{remark}
Properties 1 to 4 are not specific to black hole horizons: they are actually
valid for any boundary of the causal past of a given set $S\subset\M$.
\end{remark}
