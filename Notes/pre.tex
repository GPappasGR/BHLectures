These notes correspond to the lectures given at
Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, France in March-April 2016, in the
framework of the Advanced Lectures at IAP:

In complement to these notes, we recommend the reading of various monographs
devoted to black holes: Poisson (2004) \cite{Poiss04}, Frolov \& Zelnikov (2011) \cite{FroloZ11}
and O'Neill (1995) \cite{ONeil95}, as well as the review
articles by Carter (1987) \cite{Carte87}, Chru\'sciel (2002, 2005) \cite{Chrus02, Chrus05},
Chru\'sciel, Lopes Costa \& Heusler (2012) \cite{ChrusLH12} and Wald (2001) \cite{Wald01}.
Let us also point other lecture notes on black holes:
Dafermos and Rodnianski (2008) \cite{DaferR13},  Deruelle (2009) \cite{Derue09}
Hawking (1994) \cite{Hawki94,HawkiP15} and Townsend (1997) \cite{Towns97}.

The history of black holes in theoretical physics and astrophysics is
very rich and fascinating. It is however not discussed here, except in some
small historical notes. The interested
reader is referred to Nathalie Deruelle's lectures \cite{Derue09} or to Kip Thorne's
textbook \cite{Thorn94}.
